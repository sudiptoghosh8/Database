Football Database
Design a storage for football team information. It keeps up-to-date information 
about each team, with its players and manager. A team can participate in many 
leagues, both local and international. Players and managers are recorded with 
thier first and last name and their salary.

Conference Rooms
Our company has several conference rooms that are available to all staff. 
However, sometimes people need to use one room only to find it's already 
occupied by someone else. We need a way to keep track of usage by booking rooms 
in advance and adding all relevant people that need to attend the meeting. 
It'll be nice to have a list of all topics that will be covered during the 
meeting too.

Snooker Club Tournament
Our club holds regular tournaments for our members. During these tournaments, 
each competing player plays three matches against different opponents. These 
matches last 90 minutes each and at the end of the match, the players write 
down how many frames each player won, and their highest break.
